She listened to my ideas and was able to incorporate them into her decisions for design and style which resulted in a website that was exactly what I was asking for. I would definitely recommend her if you are looking to build a website!" <span className="font-light text-lg italic pt-2">- Giusi</span></p>  
        <p className="font-medium my-4 card bg-secondary p-4 text-base-100">"I recently had the great pleasure of working with Sasha Marshall as she designed and created a
website to display and sell my greeting cards and illustrations. Sasha was able to help me
decide on the right template to use and patiently took me through the steps as she created the
site.
She was patient, thoughtful and insightful. And in the end, I not only got a beautiful website,
but she texted me a simple explanation on how to proceed in maintaining the website in the
future.
Whatâ€™s more Sasha has checked in on my progress and answered any questions I have had
eagerly and swiftly.
I was truly impressed by Sasha Marshall, and I am sure anyone else will be as well. If you need
any more details about my experience, I will be happy to relay them to you." <span className="font-light text-lg italic pt-2">- David Kaminsky</span></p>
