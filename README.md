A react application to display all of coding projects for public display. Site was created with React, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI. 

Link to project: https://sashamarshall.dev/

Tech used: JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI

Optimizations: In the future I plan to add blogs posts I have written and tesimonials from clients. I will also continue to update it as I create more projects and learn new technologies.

Lessons Learned: This is my second project using Tailwind so there was alot of trail and error with styling but a lot of fun!
